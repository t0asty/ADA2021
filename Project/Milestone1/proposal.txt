There are many ways to analyze the dataset.
One idea could be to focus on the US elections in 2016, as many the span of the quotations make exactly the time before and after 
(Wann wurden die Kandidaturen bekanntgegeben/Vorwahlen?), to see how people's perspectives on the candidates Clinton and Trump changed in the 
time of the elections (and pre-elections). Especially in that context, it could be very interesting to 
visualize which people talk positively about which candidate, or negatively. 

It could also be interesting to cluster people on the political landscape based on their
quotes. I could imagine that maybe from the choice of words, length of quotes, and other 
features, it can be possible to map people to their political position. At this point, 
it would also be interesting to map non-political persons on the political landscape, maybe
the pope has a secret political position and would be a Trump supporter in the US?

Another point to analyze could be diplomatic relations throughout the world. For that,
one could map the quotes by president's/ministers to their countries and extract, about
which countries they talk and what their intention is. I could imagine this could 
outline some of the relations between countries, or show e.g. the constant try of
Trump to connect to North Korea. 

A bit more for fun could be to use the data to train a chatbot on specific persons. 
It would be totally funny to have a bot that can generate random artificial quotes
by the pope. It would also be interesting if this model is good enough to trick Quobert.
